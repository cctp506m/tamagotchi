<p>Gameplay and interaction with a <i>Tamagotchi</i> device begins when the player starts up the device and hatches their <i>Tama</i> egg, triggering the life cycle, which includes the baby, child, teenager, and adult phases of a <i>Tamagotchi</i> lifespan (<a href="{{ '/bibliography/#bib-wikipedia1' | url }}">"Tamagotchi"</a>). <i>Tama</i> pets progress through the stages of life normally, as long as the player takes good care of the pet; if not, death can occur at any stage.</p>

<p>Through gameplay, the player bonds with their <i>Tama</i> pet through care and play. Buttons on the device allow the player to rotate through the various types of interaction, and the health status will assist the player in selecting an appropriate activity (<a href="{{ '/bibliography/#bib-tamawiki' | url }}">"Tamagotchi_(1996_Pet)"</a>). The player can choose to feed the <i>Tama</i> pet, give it medicine, play a game with it, clean up its poo, turn off the lights when itâ€™s sleeping, or discipline it when it misbehaves. The <i>Tama</i> pet will beep when it needs attention from the player, and the player interacts with the device to determine what the <i>Tama</i> pet needs, or does not need, at that time (<a href="{{ '/bibliography/#bib-binary' | url }}">binary</a>, <a href="{{ '/bibliography/#bib-tamawiki' | url }}">"Tamagotchi_(1996_Pet)"</a>).</p>

<p>Because the <i>Tama</i> pet needs constant care, attention, and interaction, the player carries the device everywhere (<a href="{{ '/bibliography/#bib-wikipedia2' | url }}">"Tamagotchi Effect"</a>). The healthier and happier the <i>Tama</i> pet becomes, the more the player wants to care for the <i>Tama</i> pet, which leads to a healthier and happier <i>Tama</i> pet, introducing a positive feedback loop. This contributes to an emotional attachment to the <i>Tama</i> pet, and to the <i>Tamagotchi</i> device.</p>
