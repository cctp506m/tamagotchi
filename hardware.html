<p>The hardware parts inside of the <i>Tamagotchi</i> shell are not exactly something that one would consider a source of nostalgia amongst
  the average <i>Tamagotchi</i> user. With that being said, during our team's research we were surprised to discover not one, but MANY sites
  dedicated to uncovering what exactly makes a <i>Tamagtochi</i> tick; including but not limited to: <a href="http://tama.loociano.com/">tama.loociano</a>,
    <a href="https://artplusmarketing.com/another-icons-teardown-Tamagotchi-original-322dc8ed188d/">unmakr via art plus marketing</a>,
  <a href="https://www.tamatalk.com/pixelmood/tamagotchi_connection_debugging.htm">tamatalk</a>, and <a href="http://necrobones.com/tamasurg/">necrobones</a>.</p>

<p>These sites sprang up for a number of reasons. Some were created to help users “debug” or “hack” their devices so that they could do things like select
  their <i>Tama</i> pet in lieu of having one randomly generate (see <a href="https://www.tamatalk.com/pixelmood/tamagotchi_connection_debugging.htm">tamatalk</a>).
<a href="https://artplusmarketing.com/another-icons-teardown-Tamagotchi-original-322dc8ed188d/">Unmakr</a> dissected not just the physical
<i>Tamagotchi</i> device, but the  circumstances that led to the original device’s mass-popularity. <a href="{{ '/bibliography/#bib-unmakr' | url }}">Yoann Lopez and Christophe Werbrouck</a> of Unmakr included a screenshots
  of a teardown:</p>

<p>The prevalence of these sites shows that there is something about the inner-workings of the <i>Tamagotchi</i> device that attracts certain kinds of fans—tinkerers, engineers,
  programmers, professional and laymen. One can intuit that the <i>Tamagotchi</i> device was a gateway into computers for many of these young professionals and curious nerds. The
  devices are simple and relatively cheap, lending themselves to easy and low-risk exploration. When talking <i>Tamagotchi</i>, all elements, including typically unseen hardware,
  appear to matter to fans.</p>
