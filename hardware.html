<p>The hardware parts inside of the <i>Tamagotchi</i> shell are not exactly something that one would consider a source of nostalgia amongst
  the average <i>Tamagotchi</i> user. With that being said, during our teams research we were surprised to discover not one, but MANY sites
  dedicated to uncovering what exactly makes a <i>Tamagtochi</i> tick; including but not limited to: <a href=http://tama.loociano.com/>tama.loociano</a>,
    <a href= https://artplusmarketing.com/another-icons-teardown-Tamagotchi-original-322dc8ed188d/>unmaker via art plus marketing</a>,
  <a href=http://www.tamatalk.com/pixelmood/Tamagotchi_connection_debugging.htm/>tamatalk</a>, and <a href=http://necrobones.com/tamasurg/>necrobones</a>.</p>

<p>These sites sprang up for a number of reasons. Some were created to help users “debug” or I guess “hack” their Devices so that they could do things like select
  their Tama Pet in lieu of having one randomly generate (see <a href=http://www.tamatalk.com/pixelmood/Tamagotchi_connection_debugging.htm/>tamatalk</a>).
<a href= https://artplusmarketing.com/another-icons-teardown-Tamagotchi-original-322dc8ed188d/>Unmaker via art plus marketing</a> dissected not just the physical
Tamagotchi Device, but the  circumstances that led to the original Device’s mass-popularity. The authors of the Tamagotchi page on Art Plus Marketing,
Yoann Lopez and Christophe Werbrouck (both from Unmaker), also included a screenshots of a teardown:</p>

<p>The prevalence of these sites shows that there is something about the inner-workings of the <i>Tamagotchi</i> Device that attracts certain kinds of fans—tinkerers, engineers,
  programmers… professional and laymen—one can intuit that the <i>Tamagotchi</i> Device was a gateway into computers” for many of these young professionals and curious nerds. The
  Devices are simple and relatively cheap, lending themselves to easy and low-risk exploration. When talking <i>Tamagotchi</i>, all elements, including typically unseen hardware,
  appear to matter to fans.</p>
