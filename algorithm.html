<p>This flow chart illustrates how <i>Tamagotchi</i> evokes feelings of nostalgia. Users purchase either a physical <i>Tamagotchi</i> or a <i>Tama</i> pet through a smartphone app. However, users who purchase the <i>Tamagotchi</i> app will not experience the same feelings of nostalgia. Users will proceed through the life cycle of a <i>Tama</i> pet during gameplay, during which, users will care for the pet. Users receive feedback in the form of audio cues in response to gameplay choices. The interaction with the device builds emotional attachment between the user and the <i>Tama</i> pet/device. Moreover, the user is able to share the <i>Tama</i> pet with members of their community. If users stop feeling joy or pleasure from playing the game, they will get rid of the device. These users will not feel a deep sense of nostalgia compared to the users who enjoy playing the game. Users who keep playing the game as adults, because it was once a part of their childhood and serves as an intimate memory, enjoy a great sense of nostalgia.</p>
