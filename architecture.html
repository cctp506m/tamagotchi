<p>      <p>The following is a high-level overview of a standard <i>Tamagotchi</i> device that looks at the entire product as a complex interface 
  for user interaction. The box is at the highest level, as it is the image that most users are first confronted with when they first 
  see the product in a store. It is meticulously designed, featuring artistic renderings of the characters one meets through play and 
  fun descriptions of the promised gameplay. The keychain, visible in the packaging, highlights the device’s portability and use as a 
  fashion accessory (perhaps even a status symbol) for potential buyers. The case, also visible, shows off the device’s unique structure 
  and colors (there are many!) and allows users to pick a device that best-matches their individual style.</p>

<p>At a deeper level, seen typically after purchase, a user will find the gameplay accessed through direct interaction with the device. The 
  game is standardized from device to device giving users a common experience through play. The hardware, found at the deepest level by literally 
  breaking open the device and often only accessed by particularly types of fans (curious-types, tinkerers, and amateur engineers and programmers) 
  is rather simple and an ideal place for the young and curious to begin exploring the inner-workings of tech devices.</p>

<p>Above are links that dive a little deeper into each layer and below are a series of diagrams that visually break each layer down.</p></p>
