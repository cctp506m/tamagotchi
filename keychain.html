<p>The key chain (or gap in the plastic hardware, where a key chain may be added) is an essential component of the original <i>Tamagotchi</i>. The chain allows the device to hang from items carried around by an individual, such as a backpack, purse, or set of keys. The presence of the key chain allows the <i>Tamagotchi</i> to be conveniently transported by the owner. The owner is given the capacity to play on the go, perhaps during a commute, or while in school.</p>

<p>The key chain transforms the device from a mere toy to a token, an object meant to be displayed to others. This display triggers feelings of nostalgia, by allowing viewers to experience a device that has barely changed since its original inception (<a href="{{ '/bibliography/#bib-marcus' | url }}">Marcus</a> 224). <a href="{{ '/bibliography/#bib-marcus' | url }}">Marcus</a> notes, “Nostalgia is an emotion triggered by a sense of loss from changes in location or the passage of time,” (224). The design of the <i>Tamagochi</i> allows the user to briefly return to the ‘90s, and the keychain allows that feeling of nostalgia to expand beyond the user.</p>

<p>Hardware can become more than the sum of its parts. A spiral-bound notebook does not convey the same thing that a Moleskine does. A cracked iPhone tells a bigger story than how it came to be that way. The key chain links the <i>Tamagotchi</i> gameplay to the external community; visibility makes the device an object of nostalgia.</p>
